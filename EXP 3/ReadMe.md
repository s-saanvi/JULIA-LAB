### EXPERIMENT 3:

~~~
A. An amount of money P (for principal) is put into an account which earns interest at r% per annum. So, at the end of one year, the amount becomes P + PÃ—r/100. This becomes the principal for the next year. Develop a Julia program to print the amount at the end of each year for the next 10 years. However, if the amount ever exceeds 2P, stop any further printing. Your program should prompt for the values of P and r.

B. Develop a Julia program which reads numbers from a file (input.txt) and finds the largest number, smallest number, count, sum and average of numbers.
