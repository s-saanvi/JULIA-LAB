### EXPERIMENT 2:

~~~
A. Develop a Julia program for the following problem: A computer repair shop charges $100 per hour for labour plus the cost of any parts used in the repair. However, the minimum charge for any job is $150. Prompt for the number of hours worked and the cost of parts (which could be $0) and print the charge for the job.

B. Develop a Julia program to calculate a personâ€™s regular pay, overtime pay and gross pay based on the following: If hours worked is less than or equal to 40, regular pay is calculated by multiplying hours worked by rate of pay, and overtime pay is 0. If hours worked is greater than 40, regular pay is
calculated by multiplying 40 by the rate of pay, and overtime pay is calculated by multiplying the hours in excess of 40 by the rate of pay by 1.5. Gross pay is calculated by adding regular pay and overtime pay.
